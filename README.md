# Random Users App

This is an app that shows how React Native works and for understanding main concepts of React Native develpment.

1. Creating components.
2. Use of some external plugins like:

    react-native-camera

    react-native-maps

    react-navigation

3. Navigate between pages(Master-Detail) using StackNavigator from react-navigation plugin.

4. Use of Maps APIs

5. Use of StyleSheets for styling components.

6. Use of flexbox to Layout components.

7. Using flatlist component to render a list of users.

8. Paginating data from list.

9. Fetch data from external API.

10. Use image component to show user's Avatars.

Here I'm also making use of some ES6 API features like:

async/await from promises
arrow functions
